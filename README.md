# Simple Android app example with Tensorlfow Lite use

Convolutional Neural Network are current state of the art for image classification. You can find here how to implement a frozen `.tflite` model to an Android app.


## Application
The Convolutional Neural Network recognizes a dug toy. Application takes frames from camera and passes it to trained Tensorflow model for recognition.
